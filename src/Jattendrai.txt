I will wait day and night
I will always wait for your return
I will wait because the bird that flies away
Comes to seek oblivion in its nest
Time passes and runs, beating sadly
In my heart so heavy
And yet I will wait for your return

The flowers fade
The fire goes out
The shadow slips
In the garden
The clock weaves
Very tired sounds
I think I hear your footsteps
The wind brings me
Distant noises
Watching my door
I listen in vain
Alas, nothing more
Nothing more comes

I will wait day and night
I will always wait for your return

I will wait because the bird that flies away
Comes to seek oblivion in its nest
Time passes and runs, beating sadly
In my heart so heavy
And yet I will wait for your return

If the flowers
That line the paths
All withered tomorrow
I would keep in my heart

The one that
Lit up in your eyes
When I loved you so much
In the wonderful land
Of our sixteen springs
Little flower of love
You will always bloom
For me

When life
At times betrays me
You remain my happiness
Little flower

In my twenties
I stop for a moment
To breathe
This perfume that I loved so much

In my heart
You will always bloom
In the great garden of love
Little flower...
